## Assumptions

* We want to keep it simple and not use any external components for db or cache
* It's fine to build this as a simple runnable program or a command line app, protocol interfaces like http isn't required

## Notes

* print statements are equivalent to logs in a real application, skipped setting up logging to optimise for time
